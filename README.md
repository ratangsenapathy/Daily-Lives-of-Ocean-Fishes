1. The game is a prototype for a simple game of catching fishes. You need to hook onto the current target fish as shown to score points. If 30 or more fish are spawned, you will lose. Try to get as high a score as possible. No audio or high score feature has been impemented as of yet.
2. Only the mac version has been tested and is working. If bugs are found, please let me know in the comment section. Windows and linux versions have not been tested. Please inform me in the comments section below, if there are installation or gameplay problems.
